# Youssef's Game Development Projects

- [MP1](MP1/)
- [MP2](MP2/) Here is the extra credit implemented
  -  Major refactoring and cleanup (Experimenting with code organization)
  -  Experimented with a new architecture:
     -  Camera contains StateManager
     -  State is Static -- Only one copy
        -  Makes accessing the data trivial
        -  Causes some data consistency issues
     -  Any Instantiation or destruction is passed to a static function
     -  State is reset in Awake to reset at every scene switch
  -  Player:
    - Limited Lives mode (Toggle by pressing 1)
    - Bombs that can insta-kill a plane (Press 'B' to launch)
      - Slower Cooldown
      - Slower Movement Speed
      - Incredibly destructive
  - Enemy 2 (Activate by pressing 2):
    - Has 3 life units
    - changes color when hit (green, grey, red)
    - Randomized chances of getting Enemy2
  - Enemy 3 (Activate by pressing 3)
    - Has 1 life unit
    - Has trail
    - Rotates around self
    - Orbits around screen (Randomized speed and distance)
    - Oscillates between screen and itself (Randomized) --> Makes circular waves
    - Pressing space reverses rotation direction
      - The game is not easy if you limit the number of lives and enable Enemy3

  - Second Scene (Switch between Scenes by pressing N):
    - Hit space while the ball and bar collides to score a point
    - Miss the ball and you lose a life (3 in total)
    - Game over when you lose all lives
    - Hit the space bar to reverse your direction
    - Score and lives are printed at the top
  - Game Over Scene
  - Pressing N allows you to try the games again too.
