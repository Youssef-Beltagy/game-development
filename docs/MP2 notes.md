  - When lives are 0, Game Over Scene (show score on game over scene)

## Postmortem
- Submitted the project around an hour late
- Submitted the extra-credit 12-13 hours late
- Didn't sleep well
- Learned a lot
- Moral: If I'm going to stay up anyway, I might as well stay up a couple of days early and submit early.
- I don't have the time to do a good job, submit on time, and sleep well. What usually gets sacrificed is my sleep. I'm proud of my work though and I do catch up on sleep when I have a chance, so I think it is okay.
- Unity has bugs
- Spend too much time on this
