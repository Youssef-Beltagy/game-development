## Postmortem

I barely finished in time and could not submit Extra credit except by being late. If I only had 5-20 extra minutes, I would have submitted on time.

Reasons I wasted time:

- I read a lot of sources and collected a lot of resources.
- I got bogged down for a few minutes with the "Left/Right" key thing
- My initial implementation of the Egg had a minor glitch and I spent a lot of time fixing it
- I spent a lot of time making sure the eggs are reset to exactly the same size every time. This was an unnecessary waste of time because the size was approximately 0. Finding that fix cost a lot of time for no reason. But I did gain good practice and got an idea of what can possibly go wrong.
