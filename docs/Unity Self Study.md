# Final Project

## Learning Unity

Approach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFjXKOXdgGo

- Learn the basics
- Practice and build confidence with the basics
- Learn other tools when you come across them

I like tutorials that explain to me how the software works and how to use it. I don't like tutorials in which I copy-paste from an example.

## Design Guidelines

Prototyping is important: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMbIvmv25u0

- Break the game down to the smallest possible features
- Think of the overall code design

## Questions

- How to declare gameobjects?
- How to make custom gameobjects?
- How to read input?
- How to move?
- How to make a UI?
- How to build levels?
- Design patterns?
- What are parent and child gameobjects?
